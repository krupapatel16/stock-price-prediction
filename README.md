# stock-price-prediction

This study aims to use linear and support vector regression models, random forest and autoregressive time series forecasting methods autoregressive moving average (ARIMA) and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARMA) to predict the price changes and evaluate different models’ success by withholding data during training and evaluating the accuracy of these predictions using known data.

Hence, for the purpose of this project, variations in stock prices over a 4-month period can be predicted by using ten organizations’ quarterly financial reports in the form of datasets which will be collected from the Yahoo Finance repository. https://finance.yahoo.com
